========================
This is the code for the ADCC Arnold and District Camera Club website. Created in php/mysql it is all handcoded.

If doing this project today I would do it very differently, no OOP, and is buggy in places but the club was very happy with it and still use it to this day.

Sites key features are:

login system
upload of galleries
news articles
events pages
all pages editable by logging in with the right user account

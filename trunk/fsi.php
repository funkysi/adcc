	<img class="about" alt= "ME" src="../imgs/site/photo_si2.jpg" />I am not a member of the Camera Club, but being the son of Greg Foster I decided 
	to help out with his attempts to improve this site.</p>

	<p>I have an interest in photography, no doubt due to a number of years learning from my father. My current Camera is the 
	Fuji FinePix S7000 digital camera, I also own a Centon DF-300 SLR which takes standard 35mm film. 
	I prefer digital as I like to put my pictures online so that a wide audience can appreciate them. </p> 

	<p class="padding">I am also interested in Computers and the Internet. I currently work in the IT department of a small Health and Safety 
	company, working on various web projects and other admin tasks. I am familiar with programming languages such as Java and BASIC, and with 
	web technologies such as HTML and PHP. I have used these extensively on this site
	along with a MySQL database to store most of the data. I have also created RSS feeds for the <a href="../rss/news.xml">News</a> and 
	<a href="../rss/schedule.xml">Programme Schedule</a>.</p>

	<p>I am available for website projects, please send me an email 
	<a href="mailto:funkysi1701@gmail.com">funkysi1701@gmail.com</a> with the details and I will send you a cost estimate.</p>

	<p class="padding">I also welcome any comments or suggestions about this site and hope you continue to enjoy it as much as I have working 
	on it.</p>

	<p >A note about web browsers: I intend for this website to be viewable in all web browsers, but due to the huge range of 
	browsers I am unable to extensively test it in every one. I am therefore concentrating on writing my code to follow the 
	<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/">W3C specifications</a> for web accessibility. I will however recommend my browser of choice 
	<a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a>. I have also tested this site in Opera Version 9 and the two most recent 
	versions of Internet Explorer (6 and 7).</p>
